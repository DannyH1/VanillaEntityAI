### **Make mobs spawn in your server exactly like they do in vanilla!**

#### Official VanillaEntityAI precompiled builds can be found on [Poggit](https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/jasonwynn10/VanillaEntityAI/~) at https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/jasonwynn10/VanillaEntityAI/VanillaEntityAI

Have you ever been playing survival on a pocketmine server and thought "Why aren't any mobs spawning?"
Wonder no more! With this plugin, mobs spawn almost exactly like they do in vanilla!
This plugin uses custom algorithms and tracking AI to make the experience as close to vanilla as possible while keeping the server lag-free!

###### *NOTE:* VanillaEntityAI is designed to only support pmmp's version of the PocketMine-MP server software and will not work with third party builds. Any changes to the code in custom installations will not be supported. This includes removing SpoonDetector.
